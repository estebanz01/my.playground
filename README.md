# My Playground

Hey! this is my code playground. You will find a bunch of scripts and code here, usually referred in my [blog website](https://estebanz.co) or usually used as my belt tool for day-to-day work.
I promise to have the code as tidy and organized as possible :grinning:.

All code referenced here uses [MIT License](https://github.com/estebanz01/my.playground/blob/main/LICENSE), unless specified in their specific folder.
